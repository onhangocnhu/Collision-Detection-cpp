# Simple Collision Detection with C++

This project demonstrates basic 2D collision detection using C++. It includes examples for:
- A **circle vs rectangle** collision
- A **rectangle vs rectangle** collision

## Files

### `CollisionDetectionCirRectcpp.cpp`

Detects collision between a **circle** and a **rectangle**.

### `CollisionDetectionTwoRects.cpp`

Detects collision between **two axis-aligned rectangles**.

## Getting Started
### Prerequisites
Make sure your OS has the G++ (the GNU C++ compiler) installed by using the following command:

```sh
g++ --version
```

If the OS has not installed G++ yet, you should install it by online documents.

## Run the Program

```sh
g++ CollisionDetectionCirRectcpp.cpp -o cirrect
g++ CollisionDetectionTwoRects.cpp -o rects
```
